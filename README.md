# Zip Bomb Generator (Nested Zip Bomb)

This repository contains a tool and example files to create **nested ZIP bombs** — extremely compressed ZIP archives that expand exponentially when extracted, consuming massive disk space (up to petabytes).  
**Purpose:**  
This project is strictly intended for **educational and testing purposes only**, especially for testing antivirus software and extraction tools against decompression bomb attacks.

## Features
- Generate highly nested ZIP files with minimal size (<1MB)
- Simulate decompression bombs expanding up to petabytes in disk usage
- Fully transparent, open-source implementation

## ⚠️ Important Warnings
- Use only in **isolated and controlled environments** such as sandboxes or virtual machines.
- Executing or extracting these files on production or personal systems can cause data loss, crashes, or severe performance degradation.
- This repository **does NOT encourage or support any malicious use.**

## Usage
Clone this repository and run the provided scripts to generate your own nested ZIP bombs for **testing and research**.
